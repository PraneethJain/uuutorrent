=== Implementation of NF3 (Reliability - Backup & Recovery)

To satisfy the NF3 requirement for automated daily database backups with an RPO of 24 hours and RTO of 1 hour, we've implemented:

1. **pg-backup Container**: A dedicated Docker container that:
   - Runs a cron job scheduled for daily execution
   - Uses `pg_dump` to create a complete backup of the PostgreSQL database
   - Stores backups in a persistent Docker volume (`pg_backups`)
   - Maintains backup history with timestamps
   - Configured with proper database credentials via environment variables

2. **Recovery Process**:
   - In case of database failure, the operations team can:
   - Access the backup files in the `pg_backups` volume
   - Use `pg_restore` to recreate the database from the most recent backup
   - The containerized approach ensures backups are isolated from application issues

This implementation ensures that the system can recover from database failures within the specified RTO of 1 hour, with a maximum data loss of 24 hours (RPO).
